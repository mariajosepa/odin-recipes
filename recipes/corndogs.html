        <h2> Description </h2>
        <em>I love the corn dogs you buy at carnivals but wanted to make them at home so I created this easy batter for frankfurters. Great served with mustard.</em>
        <p>Did you know that corn dogs are actually quite easy to make at home? Well, they are! This homemade corn dog recipe is the perfect treat for when you can't make it to the fair or carnival.A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
